<h3>A few words on the model</h3>
<p>
The visualization illustrates a model developed at The Danish-French School of Copenhagen that shows an exponential relationship of value creation versus trust/honesty.
</p>
<p>
It works in the following way: a population consisting of a number of individuals undergo a number of transactions (iterations). Each individual is described by its capital, honesty and its trust to each of the other individuals. Each transaction occurs between two individuals A and B in the following way:
<ul>
	<li>A invests a value in B, where value = capital of A x trust between A and B</li>
	<li>B generates some added value from the investment</li>
	<li>a die is rolled and and is compared to the honesty of B: B either returns the investment (successful transaction) or keeps the full investment (unsuccessful transaction)</li>
	<li>in case of a successful transaction, the trust between A and B is increased. Conversely it is decreased in case of an unsuccessful transaction</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>
It quite clearly illustrates that for a group of individuals, adopting an honest and trustful culture is a winning strategy.
